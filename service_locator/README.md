Sample repo for design pattern study from GoF Book.Pattern Name and Classification  

The pattern's name conveys the essence of the pattern succinctly. A good name is vital, because it will become part of your design vocabulary.  

## Intent  

A short statement that answers the following questions: What does the design pattern do? What is its rationale and intent? What particular design issue or problem does it address? 
Also Known As  
Other well-known names for the pattern, if any. 

## Motivation  

A scenario that illustrates a design problem and how the class and object structures in the pattern solve the problem. The scenario will help you understand the more abstract description of the pattern that follows. 

## Applicability  

What are the situations in which the design pattern can be applied? What are examples of poor designs that the pattern can address? How can you recognize these situations? 

## Structure  

A graphical representation of the classes in the pattern using a notation based on the Object Modeling Technique (OMT) [RBP+91]. We also use interaction diagrams [JCJO92, Boo94] to illustrate sequences of requests and collaborations between objects. Appendix B describes these notations in detail. 

## Participants  

The classes and/or objects participating in the design pattern and their responsibilities. 

## Collaborations  

How the participants collaborate to carry out their responsibilities. 

## Consequences  

How does the pattern support its objectives? What are the trade-offs and results of using the pattern? What aspect of system structure does it let you vary independently? 

## Implementation  

What pitfalls, hints, or techniques should you be aware of when implementing the pattern? Are there language-specific issues? 

## Sample Code  

Code fragments that illustrate how you might implement the pattern in Java. 

## Known Uses  

Examples of the pattern found in real systems. We include at least two examples from different domains.

## Related Patterns  

What design patterns are closely related to this one? What are the important differences? With which other patterns should this one be used?
